What is RAG? - Retrieval Augmented Generation

- why do you need to know about it as a developer? - With the dawn of LLMs upon us, RAG is here to drastically scale their usability.
- Currently llms are giving you answers that often times are out of date as they are pulling data on the data they're trained on - in result at times we don't see the upto date information / correct answer & also you don't know where that data came from
- how do we fix that with RAG? - what this does is connect a llm to a data store
  - Means that when an llm actually wants to come up with an answer rather than just using it's training data it will actaully go and ask a retriever to get a specific piece of data or some content from the data store , it will then inject that kind of into the prompt or into the llm model & then it will use that data that it retrieved that is likely upto date to generate a reply
  - ex: we have an updated Database of cricket score and attach an llm to that database/dataStore and then we give a prompt asking when did the MSDHONI played his last international match and then the llm will retrive the data relevant to my prompt and inject that information into llm and it uses it to answer my question - here we have updated information and source we have got the info from
  - Now we're using the llm for it's reasoning ability & ability to understand natural language.
- RAG Architecture :
  - #1 prompt -> once u generate the prompt , you can actually vectorize that & then you can go to a retriver which will go and find all the relevant information/data required for the specific prompt -> it wil then augment the llm with that info it will essentially pass that into the prompt , the llm will give you some type of reply & then it can actually provide evidence directly from your datastore as to why it came up with that answer.
- Benefits and Advantages:
  - Allows you to avoid retraining your language models and instead augmenting them with up-to-date information
  - Source : we know it and if the llm doesn't find the answer from your source it will not try to give you a convincing answer instead it can reply with saying hey given your prompt i don't konow the answer
- concerns and considerations:

  - All of this actually work if the data that's augmented into the model is good and relevant.
  - vectorize the prompt , go to vector database and u would find all the documents that have similarity based on their vectore representation & return those

- To sum up :

```How RAG Works

RAG systems use a two-step process to answer questions or generate text:  

Retrieval: The system first retrieves relevant information from external knowledge sources, such as databases, wikis, or the internet. This is often done using a search engine or a vector database.  
Generation: The LLM then uses the retrieved information, along with its own internal knowledge, to generate a response
```

- LangChain: An open-source framework for developing RAG applications

Focus: A highly modular and flexible framework for building diverse LLM-powered applications, not just limited to RAG.
Strengths:
Extensive Integrations: Connects with a wide array of LLMs, data sources, and other tools.  
Chains: Allows you to create complex workflows by chaining together multiple components (prompts, LLMs, agents).  
Memory: Provides mechanisms for maintaining context and history in LLM interactions.  
Best for: Developers who need a versatile framework to build custom LLM applications with complex logic and integrations.

```
In essence, LlamaIndex streamlines the entire RAG process by:

Simplifying data management: Making it easy to connect to, ingest, and structure your data.  
Optimizing retrieval: Providing efficient methods to find the most relevant information.  
Facilitating LLM interaction: Handling the complexities of interacting with LLMs.
