What is RAG? - Retrieval Augmented Generation

- why do you need to know about it as a developer? - With the dawn of LLMs upon us, RAG is here to drastically scale their usability.
- Currently llms are giving you answers that often times are out of date as they are pulling data on the data they're trained on - in result at times we don't see the upto date information / correct answer & also you don't know where that data came from
- how do we fix that with RAG? - what this does is connect a llm to a data store
  - Means that when an llm actually wants to come up with an answer rather than just using it's training data it will actaully go and ask a retriever to get a specific piece of data or some content from the data store , it will then inject that kind of into the prompt or into the llm model & then it will use that data that it retrieved that is likely upto date to generate a reply
  - ex: we have an updated Database of cricket score and attach an llm to that database/dataStore and then we give a prompt asking when did the MSDHONI played his last international match and then the llm will retrive the data relevant to my prompt and inject that information into llm and it uses it to answer my question - here we have updated information and source we have got the info from
  - Now we're using the llm for it's reasoning ability & ability to understand natural language.
- RAG Architecture :
  - #1 prompt -> once u generate the prompt , you can actually vectorize that & then you can go to a retriver which will go and find all the relevant information/data required for the specific prompt -> it wil then augment the llm with that info it will essentially pass that into the prompt , the llm will give you some type of reply & then it can actually provide evidence directly from your datastore as to why it came up with that answer.
- Benefits and Advantages:
  - Allows you to avoid retraining your language models and instead augmenting them with up-to-date information
  - Source : we know it and if the llm doesn't find the answer from your source it will not try to give you a convincing answer instead it can reply with saying hey given your prompt i don't konow the answer
- concerns and considerations:

  - All of this actually work if the data that's augmented into the model is good and relevant.
  - vectorize the prompt , go to vector database and u would find all the documents that have similarity based on their vectore representation & return those

- To sum up :

```How RAG Works

RAG systems use a two-step process to answer questions or generate text:  

Retrieval: The system first retrieves relevant information from external knowledge sources, such as databases, wikis, or the internet. This is often done using a search engine or a vector database.  
Generation: The LLM then uses the retrieved information, along with its own internal knowledge, to generate a response
```

- LangChain: An open-source framework for developing RAG applications

Focus: A highly modular and flexible framework for building diverse LLM-powered applications, not just limited to RAG.
Strengths:
Extensive Integrations: Connects with a wide array of LLMs, data sources, and other tools.  
Chains: Allows you to create complex workflows by chaining together multiple components (prompts, LLMs, agents).  
Memory: Provides mechanisms for maintaining context and history in LLM interactions.  
Best for: Developers who need a versatile framework to build custom LLM applications with complex logic and integrations.

```
In essence, LlamaIndex streamlines the entire RAG process by:

Simplifying data management: Making it easy to connect to, ingest, and structure your data.  
Optimizing retrieval: Providing efficient methods to find the most relevant information.  
Facilitating LLM interaction: Handling the complexities of interacting with LLMs.
```

Here's a slightly more detailed breakdown to solidify your understanding:

LLMs and their limitations: LLMs are amazing at generating human-like text, but they have limitations. Their knowledge is based on the data they were trained on, which can be outdated or incomplete. They also don't have access to real-time information or specific private data.

RAG to the rescue: RAG addresses these limitations by connecting LLMs to external data sources. This allows the LLM to access and process information beyond its initial training data, leading to more accurate, relevant, and up-to-date responses.

The process:

User prompt: A user asks a question or gives a command.
Retrieval: The RAG system searches the connected data store (this could be a database, a collection of documents, or even the internet) to find relevant information.
Augmentation: The retrieved information is used to "augment" the LLM's knowledge, giving it the context it needs to generate a good response.
Generation: The LLM uses its internal knowledge and the augmented information to generate a response to the user's prompt.
LlamaIndex and LangChain: These are tools that help you implement RAG. They provide the infrastructure for connecting to data sources, indexing the data, retrieving relevant information, and integrating with LLMs. They make it easier to build RAG applications without having to write all the code from scratch.

In essence, RAG acts like a bridge between LLMs and the real world, allowing them to access and process information that would otherwise be unavailable to them. This makes LLMs much more powerful and versatile, enabling them to be used for a wider range of applications.

- About vectors, vector search, and vector databases in the context of LLMs and RAG.

```
1. What are Vectors?

Imagine you want to describe a movie. You could say it's "action-packed," "funny," and has a "bit of romance."  These are descriptive words, but computers prefer numbers. A vector is a way to represent these qualities numerically. So, your movie might be represented by a vector like:

Action: 0.9 (high)
Comedy: 0.7 (medium)
Romance: 0.3 (low)

This list of numbers is a vector. It captures the essence of the movie in a way a computer can understand.

In the world of LLMs, vectors represent the meaning of text. Each word, sentence, or even a whole document can be converted into a vector that captures its semantic meaning.

2. What is Vector Search?

Now, imagine you want to find similar movies. You wouldn't search for the exact same numbers in the vector. Instead, you'd look for movies with similar vectors - maybe high action, medium comedy, and low romance. This is vector search. It finds items with similar meanings, even if they don't have the exact same words.

In LLMs, vector search helps find documents or information that are semantically similar to a user's query. This is crucial for RAG because it allows the LLM to retrieve relevant information even if the user doesn't use the exact same keywords as the documents.

3. What are Vector Databases?

A vector database is specifically designed to store and efficiently search through these vectors. Think of it as a library where books are organized not by title or author, but by their "meaning vectors." You tell the librarian what you're looking for (your query vector), and they quickly find books with similar meanings.

In RAG, vector databases store the vector representations of your data (documents, knowledge base, etc.). When a user asks a question, the RAG system converts the question into a vector and uses the vector database to find relevant information to augment the LLM.

How it all works together in LLMs and RAG:

Data preparation: You convert your data (documents, web pages, etc.) into vectors using an embedding model.

Storage: These vectors are stored in a vector database.

Querying: When a user asks a question, it's also converted into a vector.

Search: The vector database performs a vector search to find the most similar vectors (and thus, the most relevant information) to the query vector.

Augmentation: This relevant information is retrieved and fed to the LLM.

Response generation: The LLM uses this augmented information to generate a comprehensive and accurate response.
